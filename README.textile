h1. Continued Fraction Calculator

To calculate the continued fraction from a specified value and to compare
two different continued fractions I have implemented the continued
fraction calculator library can command line application @fractionscli.@
The application is available under 
the "GPLv3":https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html license free of charge.


h2. Manual

@fractionscli@ - calculates and prints the continued fractions from the specified
value.

h3. Synopsis

<pre>
fractionscli [-service service] [-value-format|-f format] (([-max maximum]
-denominators|-d denominators)|(-fraction-a|-a denominators -fraction-b|-b
denominators)|_value_)
</pre>

h3. Description

Prints the calculated continued fractions from the specified value or prints the
calculated value from the specified denominators. Different calculation
algorithms can be chosen to calculate the continued fraction. If two continued
fractions are specified then those are compared for inequality.

h3. Options

@-service service@

Sets the calculation algorithm specified by the service name. Defaults to the
"IntegerFraction" algorithm.

    "IntegerFraction": standard algorithm, z=1.0; n0..ni ∈ ℕ
    "IntegerNoMinusOneFraction"
    "Mod3Fraction"

@-max maximum@

Sets the maximum count of denominators for the value. Defaults to ten (10)
denominators.

@-value-format|-f format@

Sets the value format to parse the denominators and to format the calculated
value of the continued fraction. Defaults to the @NumberFormat#getInstance()@
formatter. See "DecimalFormat":http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html

@-denominators|-d denominators@

If the denominators are specified then the value of the continued fraction with
the specified denominators is printed.

@-fraction-a|-a denominators -fraction-b|-b denominators@

Sets the denominators for the first and second continued fraction to be compared
for inequality and prints the inequality:

* -1 if a<b
* 0 if a=b
* 1 if a>b

@value@

If the value is specified then the continued fraction is calculated from this
value and the denominators are printed. Either denominators or value can be
specified at the same time.

h3. Examples

<pre>
$ fractionscli 62.8908766605
</pre>

    calculates and prints out the continued fraction of the value with a maximum
depth of ten denominators;

<pre>
$ fractionscli -max 6 62.8908766605
</pre>

    calculates and prints out the continued fraction of the value with a maximum
depth of six denominators;

<pre>
$ fractionscli -service IntegerFraction -value-format 0.###### -denominators
"[63;-9,-6,-10,-34,2]"
</pre>

    calculates and prints out the value of the continued fraction from the
specified denominators;

<pre>
$ fractionscli -a "[63;-9,-6,-10,-34,2]" -b "[63;-9,-6,-10,-34,20]"
</pre>

    compares and prints out the inequality the first and second continued
fraction from the specified denominators;
